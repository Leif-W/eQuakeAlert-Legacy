# eQuake alert #

eQuake alert is a handy **firefox add-on**, which alerts you with the basic information (date, location, and magnitude) of each earthquake. By default your browser will shake proportional to the earthquake magnitude. You can configure the alert methods to show message box / status bar icon or message and even you can limit the alerts by the earth quake magnitude. The recent quakes menu provides a link to the detailed information of quake @ the USGS (US Geological Survey) website.
